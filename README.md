## Security
Farcoin uses ECDSA keys (over the secp256k1 curve) and Sha3-512 for hashing.

## Setup Instructions (for testing purposes)
1. Download and install the [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started).
2. Download the FarCoin project files.
3. Navigate to the downloaded `farcoin` project folder and run (double-click) the `launch.bat` (for Windows).
4. Once you launch this, you should see a terminal window open up with some messages.
5. Go to your web browser and navigate to the URL `localhost:3000`, which should take you to the FarCoin homepage.

## TODO
* Add saving world state
* Remove use of private keys in the backend
* Organize some of the backend code
